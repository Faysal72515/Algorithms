First Come First Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR) &amp; Shorted Job First (JFS) Algorithms

-> First Come First Serve (FCFS): is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival. It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, processes which requests the CPU first get the CPU allocation first. This is managed with a FIFO queue. The full form of FCFS is First Come First Serve.

-> Round Robin (RR): Scheduling is a scheduling algorithm used by the system to schedule CPU utilization. This is a preemptive algorithm. There exist a fixed time slice associated with each request called the quantum. The job scheduler saves the progress of the job that is being executed currently and moves to the next job present in the queue when a particular process is executed for a given time quantum.

-> The shortest job first (SJF) or shortest job next, is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next. SJN, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), can be preemptive or non-preemptive.
